# Automated Contracting Tool

Automated Contracting Tool, a component of smashHit. smashHit is a Horizon 2020 project with the primary objective of creating a secure and trustworthy data-sharing platform with a focus on consent and contract management in a distributed environment such as the automotiveindustry, insurance and smart cities following GDPR.

## Software Requirements

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- [Flask-RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [uwsgi](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [flask_apispec](https://flask-apispec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [SPARQLWrapper](https://rdflib.dev/sparqlwrapper/)
- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

## Steps to be followed
- git clone [https://github.com/AmarTauqeer/Contract.git](https://github.com/AmarTauqeer/Contract.git).
- go to the backend folder.
- install GraphDB instance on your computer/laptop.
- Install the GraphDB instance on the server. GraphDB can be downloaded from [https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/download/).
- After successfully installing, point to the GraphDB Desktop icon. It will open the URL=[http://localhost:7200/](http://localhost:7200/).
- Create a new repository from Setup->repository or via url= [http://localhost:7200/repository/create/graphdb](http://localhost:7200/repository/create/graphdb). The name of the repository and its ID is required.
- import Contract.rdf to GraphDB (Import->upload rdf files->click on import button and select the default graph option)
- Select the created repository from the dropdown at the top right corner.
- After selecting the repository click on the GraphDB icon on the top left corner, it will show the current active repository with different links. Select the link symbol that will show the SPARQL endpoint, which can be used for any type of SPARQL query form everywhereâ€”for instance, [http://amartauqeer:7200/repositories/Contract](http://amartauqeer:7200/repositories/Contract). Contract-license is the repository name where the remaining parts belong to the GraphDB instance.
- Finally, these are the URLs for accessing and inserting records into the GraphDB instance: HOST_URI_GET='http://server-url/repositories/Contract, HOST_URI_POST='http://server-url/repositories/Contract/statements'.
- update the .env file with above mentioned urls.
- sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up.

## Running Locally

Run the command below from the root directory for deployement and access via [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001). The Swagger API documentation can be accessed via [http://localhost:5001/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:5001/swagger-ui/).

```bash
python -m flask run

```

## Important Note For Testing REST Endpoints
- For hasContractStatus choose from the list (statusCreated, statusUpdate)
- For hasStates choose from the list (statePending, stateInvalid, stateValid)
- For hasRole choose from the list (DataSubject, DataController, DataProcessor)
- For hasContractCategory choose from the list (categoryBusinessToConsumer, categoryBusinessToBusiness)

## Steps to create/update a contract

- Create term types and companies.
- Create contractors (need company id).
- Create a contract with basic information except contract terms, contract obligations, and contract signatures.
- Use the contract id from the previous step and create contract terms, contract obligations and contract signatures.
- Update the contract with terms, obligations, and signatures.
